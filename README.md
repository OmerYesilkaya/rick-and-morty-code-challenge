## Bitexen React.js code challenge

Project is made up of 3 pages;
* All episodes
* Episode details
* Character details

All episodes is where I show all the episodes from the show. Episodes are clickable. Once clicked, user will head to episode details.

In this page there is basic information like name of the episode, date of the episode aired and episode number. Below basic information there are the characters from that episode. These characters are filterable from the top of the episode details page.

These characters are also clickable, which upon clicking will get user to character details. Character details include all the information provided by the api. User can move to both next and previous characters(next/prev character in all of the show, not the next/prev character in that episode).

Fetching from api has been implemented with ReactQuery. All of the UI was implemented with ChakraUI. 



#### Technologies/Libraries used:

* React js
* TypeScript
* React Query
* Chakra UI
* React-Router-Dom
